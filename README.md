# Credit_Card_Approval_ML


Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

- While building this credit card predictor, tackled some of the most widely-known preprocessing steps such as scaling, label encoding, and missing value imputation. Finished with some machine learning to predict if a person's application for a credit card would get approved or not given some information about that person.

- The best model is RandomForestClassifier which uses Ensemble learning method using Bagging Technique. The model has accuracy score of 92 using deafult hyperparameters.
